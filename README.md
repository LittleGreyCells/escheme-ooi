escheme-oops
================

The escheme interpreter is implemented using what might be considered object-oriented programming techniques -- classes, virtual functions, and templates.

## Introduction

In this old project I answer the question whether it possible to implement escheme
using a purely object-oriented approach.

## Implementation Constraints

* No discriminated unions.
* No analysis based on object type. Use instead dynamic dispatch.

## Under Construction

Almost all of the original escheme system is completed with the exception of a handful of custom object access primtive.

Testing underway.

Stay tuned.
