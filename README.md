escheme-oops
================

The escheme interpreter is implemented using object-oriented programming stylistic considerations and supporting language features.

## Introduction

In this old project I answer the question whether it possible to implement escheme
using a purely object-oriented approach. Yes it is!

## Implementation Constraints

* No discriminated unions.
* No analysis based on object type. Use instead dynamic dispatch.

## Under Construction

Almost all of the original escheme system is completed with the exception of closure accessors and an environment constructor.

Test underway.

Stay tuned.
