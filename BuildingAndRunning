Building and Running

Building

In the root directory type 'make' to build the executable:

   $ make


Running

To run the interpreter in the build directory invoke escheme. The banner is printed and the
*terminal* prompt is displayed:

   $ ./escheme
   escheme-oops <interpreter>

   oops>

Files can by loaded before the prompt if listed on the command line::

   $ ./escheme <file1> <file2> ... <filen>
   

To exit escheme, type ^D, ^C or exit function at the prompt:

   oops> (exit)


Installation and Removal

The scheme interpeter and its supporting files can be installed on Unix/Linux systems.

   $ sudo make install

The interpreter can now be invoked anywhere, not just off of the build directory, using the
pathless executable name "escheme". The executable is installed in /usr/local/bin which
should be included in the path definition, if not already.

Lastly the interpreter can be uninstalled.

   $ sudo make uninstall
